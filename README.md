# Utah-Snowfall-Prediction

In this project I use modern regression methods to predict snowfall in Utah and the Western United States. Read the "Final Report.pdf" for the details and results. The SAS code is found in the appendix. The data used to build the statistical models is located in "snowloads.csv".
